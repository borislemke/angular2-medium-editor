# angular2-medium-editor
This is an Angular 2 directive for the [Medium.com inline editor clone](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) by Davi Ferreira, derived from the [AngularJS medium editor directive](https://github.com/thijsw/angular-medium-editor).

## Installing the Directive

Install with [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save angular2-medium-editor
```

It is required to include the [Medium editor](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) in your Angular 2 project as well.

```bash
$ npm install --save medium-editor
```

If all goes well, the angular2-medium-editor package should import medium-editor from your node_modules.

Import the style-sheet files into your project:

```css
@import 'path/to/node_modules/medium-editor/dist/css/medium-editor.css';
// Optionally import any pre-built themes you want to use
@import 'path/to/node_modules/medium-editor/dist/css/themes/beagle.css';
```

If you are using `angular-cli`, you can add these in your .angular-cli.json file:

```json
...
    "styles": [
        "../node_modules/medium-editor/dist/css/medium-editor.css",
        "../node_modules/medium-editor/dist/css/themes/beagle.css",
        "styles.css"
    ],
...
```

Finally, import the directive into your project:

```typescript
  import { MediumEditorDirective } from 'angular2-medium-editor/medium-editor.directive.ts';
```

And add the directive to your Declarations:

```typescript
  @NgModule({
    ...
    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ],
    declarations: [
      MediumEditorDirective,
      ...
```


## Usage

Use as an element:

```html
  <medium-editor [(editorModel)]="textVar"
      [editorOptions]="{'toolbar': {'buttons': ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3']}}" 
      [editorPlaceholder]="placeholderVar"></medium-editor>
```

You can optionally pass a placeholder value:

```html
  <medium-editor [(editorModel)]="textVar"
      [editorOptions]="{'toolbar': {'buttons': ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3']}}" 
      [editorPlaceholder]="placeholderVar"></medium-editor>
```

For more information on which options you can pass with [editorOptions], check MediumEditor's [options documentation](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor#mediumeditor-options) for details.
